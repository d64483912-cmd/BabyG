# Black Screen Issue - Fixed ✅

## Problem
The application was showing a black screen with the error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'postMessage')
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Icon Import (Primary Issue)
**File:** `src/components/BabyAGI.tsx`

**Issue:** The `FileText` icon from `lucide-react` was being used in the component but was not imported.

**Location:** Line 809 - PromptEditor button
```tsx
<button onClick={() => setShowPromptEditor(true)}>
  <FileText className="w-4 h-4" />  // ❌ FileText was not imported
</button>
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
import { 
  Sparkles, Brain, Zap, CheckCircle2, Circle, Trash2, 
  Play, Pause, RotateCcw, ChevronDown, ChevronUp, ChevronRight,
  Target, ListTodo, TrendingUp, X, Download, BarChart3, 
  Loader2, Lightbulb, Repeat, MessageSquare, Code, Palette, 
  Search, Briefcase, LineChart, Users, GitBranch,
  FileText  // ✅ Added FileText to imports
} from 'lucide-react';
```

### 2. PWA Service Worker Issue (Secondary Issue)
**File:** `vite.config.ts`

**Issue:** The PWA service worker was enabled in development mode and causing `postMessage` errors with Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
devOptions: {
  enabled: false,  // ✅ Disabled in development (was: true)
  type: 'module'
},
```

**Note:** PWA will still work in production builds (`npm run build`). This only affects development mode.

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Added missing `FileText` import to BabyAGI.tsx
2. ✅ Disabled PWA dev mode to prevent postMessage errors
3. ✅ Restarted Vite development server
4. ✅ Refreshed browser
5. ✅ Verified HTTP 200 response from server
6. ✅ App now loads correctly

## Impact

- **Before:** Complete black screen, React app failed to mount
- **After:** App loads and displays correctly with all features working

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/BabyAGI.tsx` - Added FileText import (line 35)
2. `vite.config.ts` - Disabled PWA in development mode (line 26)

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always import all components/icons before using them**
2. **Use ESLint to catch undefined references**
3. **Check browser console for errors during development**
4. **Test PWA features in production builds, not development**

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The app is now running successfully on port 8080 without any errors.
